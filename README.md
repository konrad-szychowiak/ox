# ox

`ox` is a simple, bash-driven, console :o: noughts and crosses :x: :video_game: game.

## Installation

Enable executing the file.

```bash
chmod u+x ox
```

### `PATH`

If you really want, you can add `xo` to your PATH.

1. Open your terminal and check the PATH variable:

   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   ```

2. You will find a list of directories on your path, witch looks like this (more or less):

   ```
   /path/to/some/directory:â€¦:/and/here/to/some/other/one
   ```

   It's likely, that you will find a directory like `/home/$USER/bin` or `/home/$USER/.local/bin`. (`$USER` will be your username in the system.)

3. Now move or link `ox` to one of those PATH directories. I highly suggest something local like mentioned `/home/$USER/bin` or `/home/$USER/.local/bin`.

4. Now you can accesses `xo` from every place.

## Usage

```sh
# without adding to PATH
./ox -h

# with PATH
ox -h
which ox # should return the path to the directory you've chosen
```
